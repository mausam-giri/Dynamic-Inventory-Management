# Dynamic Inventory Management Table
Build a simple inventory management app using React.js. The app should display a table of items in stock and allow users to:
- Add new items to the inventory.
- Edit and delete existing items.
- Filter the table by item category.
- Sort items by quantity.
- Highlight low-stock items (e.g., quantity below 10).
